# This file is an experimental run.
# 
# It gives everything required to put a collection of boards back
# into a reproducible state and take data.
#
# I feel this is better than a GUI, because it is a written transcript of exactly
# what is done to get a certain set of data from a certain set of boards.
#
####################################################################################

import eevee
import lappd

#
# STEP 1 - get control connections
#
#######################################

# Get all the boards on the subnet
broadcast = '10.0.6.255'
boards = eevee.discover(broadcast)

#
# STEP 2 - initialize the boards
#
########################################

# Set some default threshold values for all boards
regs = {}
for i in range(0,16):
    regs[THRES_OFFSET | i] = 500

# Initialize all boards with these values
for board in boards:

    board.poke(regs)

    # Queue enable of flag to read out all hits on all channels
    # (for pedestaling)
    board.poke(FULL_READOUT, 1)

    # Execute the poke
    board.transact()

#
# STEP 3 - fork a raw event handler
#
########################################

# This forks (process) and returns a process safe queue.Queue.
# The fork listens for, and then reassembles, fragmented data and
# then shifts this data according delay line offset.
#
# Data is in the form of dictionaries, that have event header fields
# augmented with a list of channels that link to hits
#
# If a hit was not received on that channel, the type is set to None
